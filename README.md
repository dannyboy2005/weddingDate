# weddingDate
A wedding website created for my own wedding
I created this website as me and my fiance were reluctant to send out invites with a blank sheet on for ordering food at our reception.

The site contains a short story about us, a gallery in a grid formation and is fully responsive.
There is a menu select section that allows you to RSVP and select meals for up to 4 guests which are then emailed to myself and my fiance 
through the netlify form submission process. 

The site is fully responsive and made using up to date design methods and styles in my fiances colour choices.

Thank you
